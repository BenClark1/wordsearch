# Word Search
In this project, I learned advanced skills involving strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples in Python. Given a puzzle and a set of words, this program locates the position of the first letter of each word in the puzzle. It checks for words that are oriented forward, backward, up, down, and diagonally (down and to the right only). To run the program, make sure you have all the files in a directory then enter this command into your terminal:
```
$ python3 word_finder.py < puzzle0
```
or replace puzzle0 with puzzle1 or puzzle2 to see other examples. If a word is not in a puzzle, the program will display the message "word not found". 

Alternatively you can input your own puzzle as long as it is exactly 100 characters (10x10). To do this you should run the command:
```
$ python3 word_finder.py
```
and then enter your puzzle followed by your words separated by spaces like this:
```
EOARBRNIABZEBRAEBRBHARRACCOONRAACBRRCHECCNABOZOBKABONIRBBNCAEERTCBRAIAABCERICRHRBOIORORCCOBOAAKRKEAR
CHICKEN DOG CAT BEAR RABBIT ZEBRA MOUSE RACCOON
```
I am always trying to learn from my mistakes, so please [provide feedback or suggestions for improvement](https://github.com/BenClark1/ptap_ads1115/issues). Your input is much appreciated.
